The following repository contains the code and data used to produce my talked titled "Disaggregating bike-share mobility data to measure urban segregation over time" presented at IC2S2 2023. 

The original, raw Bluebike can be retrieved from the [Bluebikes webiste](https://www.bluebikes.com/system-data).
